# Pacienti

Patient management system for medical specialists.

Pacienti is a platform that provides a patient management system for
medical specialists. It performs multiple functionalities including storing patients' appointments, presenting patients statistically to their medical experts, and printing the appointments in a template.

This system including the frontend, backend and UI is programmed by me. 

This repository has no code due to code privacy and legal issues.
